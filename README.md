Elastic Beanstalk reduces management complexity without restricting choice or control. Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling, and application health monitoring. 3 main parts to hosting

## Challenges encountered, lessons learned, and future improvements

- Struggled with URL linking issue which caused issues with my update and delete routes
- Site is currently HTTP (not secure). Would need to go to backend to re-do. 
- I would like to add more functionality to this application. Some are:     
    - Connect with a nutrition API and render "nutrition scores" to users based on their recipe input
    - Ability to show "Card of the Week" based on combination of likes and nutrition score a particular users' card has
