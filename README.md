## Challenges encountered, lessons learned, and future improvements

- Struggled with how to properly render react props inside react components 
- Struggled with in-line CSS styling but eventually got help and clarification from team 
- I would like to add more functionality to this application. Some are: 
    - JWT authorization 
    - A functionality that allows users to post specific cards to a homepage
    - Ability to show "Card of the Week" based on number of likes a particular users' card has
